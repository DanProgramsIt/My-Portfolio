                    <p>
                        Hello, My name is Daniel Mendez. I am a real estate agent in the state of Connecticut and have been for 2 years.
                        As a real estate agent my goal is to find the right house my client is asking for and make sure that the transaction 
                        goes by smoothly while answering any question that they might have.I work another two jobs as well. I work as a 
                        security guard in the Wethersfield Public Library for 12 years & I work at the Cromwell Belden Library as library 
                        aid for 5 years. While working these jobs i've always had this fascination of computers, how fun they are to use 
                        and what amazing things you could accomplish while working with others on different projects, games or social media.
                        Not to long ago my father asked me, "If you like compuetr's so much why not work in that field" and thats when I looked 
                        into many jobs involving computers and coding.The one job that stood out to me the most is Software Engineering. From 
                        there I decided to take a Boot Camp class for coding and to take one more step into becoming a Software Engineer!
